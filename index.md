# Emphasis on AI and ML security in the Public Sector

Created a blog post that highlights the increasing adoption of AI and machine learning (ML) in the public sector and its transformative impact on government operations, citizen services, and policy-making. It explores how Oracle Cloud’s AI/ML solutions help address challenges like data security, scalability, and compliance, enabling government agencies to enhance efficiency, automate processes, and improve public service delivery. As AI continues to shape society, governments must stay ahead by leveraging cutting-edge technology to drive innovation and better serve their communities.

# Deploying an OCI Web Application Firewall 

Created a blog that walks through the process of configuring a load balancer for a web server hosted on an Oracle Cloud compute instance and securing it with OCI Web Application Firewall (WAF) as part of a comprehensive security strategy. The blog will be published soon after the publishing process is complete. I will link it in this website once this process is over.


# Static Analysis Demo

In this demo, I performed static malware analysis on a keylogger executable and Python script to identify its functionality and potential threats without executing it. By extracting metadata, analyzing embedded strings, and verifying hashes against threat intelligence databases, I uncovered key indicators of compromise (IOCs) and assessed the malware’s behavior. 
Key Steps:

* Keylogger Creation & Analysis: Developed a basic keylogger to understand how malicious keylogging software is structured.

* Executable & Python Script Analysis: Examined PE headers and imports.

* Hash Analysis: Generated MD5, SHA-256 hashes and cross-referenced them with open-source threat intelligence platforms (VirusTotal).

* Embedded String Extraction: Used strings analysis to uncover potential file paths.

* Threat Intelligence Correlation: Checked the MD5 hash in public databases to see if it matched any known malware signatures.


Key Takeaways:

* Identified static indicators of a keylogger.

* Demonstrated low-risk malware analysis techniques that can be applied in real-world security operations.

* Validated findings using open-source intelligence (OSINT) tools to strengthen detection capabilities.

## Dynamic Analysis Demo

In this demo, I performed dynamic malware analysis on a keylogger executable and Python script, observing its real-time behavior in a sandboxed environment while also testing its ability to bypass Windows Defender and built-in security mechanisms. This included analyzing process execution, file system modifications, network activity, and anti-virus evasion techniques.

Key Steps:

* Safe Execution Environment: Deployed the malware in an isolated virtual machine to prevent host system compromise.

* Windows Defender Evasion: Obfuscated the script/executable to avoid signature-based detection.

* Used custom packing techniques to prevent AV detection.

* Tested execution against Windows Defender and noted bypassed security alerts.

* Keylogging Behavior Analysis: Verified that the malware successfully captured keystrokes and logged them without detection.


Key Takeaways:

* Successfully bypassed Windows Defender using obfuscation and packing techniques.

* Demonstrated how keyloggers operate dynamically, confirming findings from static analysis.

* Identified key persistence mechanisms and stealth techniques used by malware.

* Gained hands-on experience in behavior-based malware detection and defense evasion tactics.

# Coffee Chats | OCI, APEX, SQL

* 	Developed a matching app using Oracle APEX to facilitate weekly virtual dates by randomly pairing users based on preferences and availability.
  
* 	Created random pairing algorithms with SQL to ensure a dynamic and engaging match experience, ensuring no repeat pairings and leveraging user preferences for better matches.
  
* 	 Designed and optimized SQL queries for retrieving and updating user profiles, match histories, and pairing statuses, ensuring performance scalability as the app grew.



# Secure Cloud Architectures: OCI IAM and WAF

* 	Designed and implemented a comprehensive cloud security architecture using OCI Cloud Guard, IAM policies, and Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) to protect cloud infrastructure and applications from security threats.
  
* 	Leveraged OCI Cloud Guard to proactively monitor and detect potential security risks across cloud resources, automating threat identification and remediation actions.
  
* 	Developed and enforced role-based access controls (RBAC) through OCI IAM policies, ensuring secure, granular access management and aligning permissions with the principle of least privilege.
  
* 	Configured Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) to safeguard web applications from common threats like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

The reference architecture below displays how CloudGuard, IAM polices, etc would be designed in OCI
